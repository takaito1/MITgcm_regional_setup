# Regional MITgcm setup

## Before you start
  - Download MITgcm source code from the github repo at https://mitgcm.org
  - Read the documentation, especially chapter 3
  - Compile and execute the global ocean circulation example in the verification folder
  - Have access to python3 with the following packages, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, pandas, netCDF4, xarray, xmitgcm 

## Bathymetry
  - Download etopo2.nc (Smith and Sandwell, 1997) from here, https://o2.eas.gatech.edu/data/etopo2.nc
  - Original data is documented here, https://sos.noaa.gov/catalog/datasets/etopo2-topography-and-bathymetry-natural-colors/#description-data-source
